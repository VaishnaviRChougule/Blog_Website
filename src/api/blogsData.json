With its various hues, tones, and temperatures, natural light photography offers a diverse palette for creating awesome pictures. For natural light photography enthusiasts, the all-important question is - When precisely is the best time of day to take pictures? The answer is less than satisfying, but it's pretty simple. It depends. Before you can determine when the best time to take pictures is, you'll need to decide what sort of photos you want to make. What is the mood you want to capture? What is your subject, and how do you want it to look in the images? These are artistic choices, only bound by your creativity and technical abilities with a camera. ",

Architectural examples embodying UD principles include features like curb cuts benefiting various users (e.g., individuals on skateboards or parents with strollers), as well as automatic doors, elevators, and lever-style door handles (Higbee & Goff, 2008). These principles of Universal Design have transitioned into the educational sphere through various models, such as Universal Design for Learning (UDL; Rose & Meyer, 2000), Universal Design for Instruction (UDI; Scott et al., 2003), and Universal Instructional Design (UID; Silver et al., 1998). According to Higbee and Goff (2008), these models are interrelated and complement each other.Our focus in this post is on Universal Design for Learning, popularly known by the acronym UDL. My purpose behind this post is to introduce you to UDL, explain what it is and talk about the different ways you can use it in your classroom to enhance your teaching and boost students learning. To learn more about UDL, I encourage you to dig deeper into references at the bottom of the post.",
